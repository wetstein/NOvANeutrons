The samples for the different neutron models can be found here:

There is now a version of MCNP with a low energy cut off to distinguish between Geant and MCNP.

Emrah is going to start working on the single particle gen comparisons for the different models 
at a few energies and positions in the detector

Closure studies for MCNP first. Geant with Geant with library compared with default geant

Comparison of MCNP with geant: we can set a minimum and maximum energy range for the MCNP libarary.
