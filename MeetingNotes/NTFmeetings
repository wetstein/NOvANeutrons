Miranda gave updates on her neutron prong studies. Made some improvements and changeges to the code.
* Showed a single neutron + muon prong multiplicity plot with all KE ranges together. 
**As expected the percent of 0-prong events drops and higher prong multiplicites become more common.
* Next she showed plots of the minimum difference between multiple neutron prongs
** It seems to be bimodal. One peak is close, but overall the prongs are widely distributed.
** Alex: what does the background look like?
** Dan: the first peak gets more prominent with higher energy
** Matt: can we use directionality of elastic scatters to point to each successive vertex?
* Will make multiplicity plots, separating prongs by the secondary particle that produced it
* Also planning on scanning events to understand the two peaks in the proton ID
