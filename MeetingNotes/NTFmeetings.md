# NTF Meetings:

Miranda gave updates on her neutron prong studies. Made some improvements and changeges to the code.
* Showed a single neutron + muon prong multiplicity plot with all KE ranges together. 
As expected the percent of 0-prong events drops and higher prong multiplicites become more common.
* Next she showed plots of the minimum difference between multiple neutron prongs
It seems to be bimodal. One peak is close, but overall the prongs are widely distributed.
Alex: what does the background look like?
Dan: the first peak gets more prominent with higher energy.
Matt: can we use directionality of elastic scatters to point to each successive vertex?
* Will make multiplicity plots, separating prongs by the secondary particle that produced it
* Also planning on scanning events to understand the two peaks in the proton ID

Dan updated us on the MCNP library. Not too much progress. Did generate an large new library from Dan's 5M event sample. Need to follow up with Chris about the implementation. In simulating JINR tests of sccintillator in a glass couvett shown in the DetSim meeting. Some anomolies were noticed in both geant and MCNP that look fishy. See doc-db:  .

Emrah presented on his work:
* He is working on the closure tests and, in the single particle gun simulations, he is looking at separating the time evolution of FLS hits. by truth-level process
* Emrah is working with Karl on generating production samples. He is looking at tests right now, just to make sure they look good.
